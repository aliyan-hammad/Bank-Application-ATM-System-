# Bank Application (ATM System)

## Description
This is a simple Python-based bank and ATM system using Object-Oriented Programming concepts. Users can log in, withdraw cash, deposit money, check balances, and transfer funds. The application demonstrates abstraction and composition with modular classes for Bank, ATM, User, and Transfer operations.

## How It Works
- Run the main file: `index.py` in the `composition` folder.
- The program will prompt you to select either Banking or ATM services.
- **Banking**: Log in, view your profile, withdraw cash, deposit money, or transfer funds.
- **ATM**: Log in and access ATM-specific operations like withdrawal, balance inquiry, and fund transfer.
- All operations are handled through interactive menus in the terminal.

## Main File
The main file to run is:
```
composition/index.py
```
Use the following command in your terminal:
```
python3
